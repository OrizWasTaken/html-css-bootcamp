# Other Assorted Useful CSS Properties

## 94. Opacity & The Aplha Channel

- The `opacity` property sets the opacity of an element and _all its decendants_; values range from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque).

- `position`:

  `static`: element is positioned according to document's normal flow; `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` have _no_ effect; this is the default value.

  `relative`: element is positioned according to document's normal flow; `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` offset element relative to _itself_.

  `absolute`: element is _removed_ from document's normal flow; `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` offset element relative to its nearest*positioned* ancestor (if any) or to the initial containing block.

  `fixed`: element is _removed_ from document's normal flow; `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` offset relative to its initial containing block.
