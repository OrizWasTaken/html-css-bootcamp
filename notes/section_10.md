## 109. Align-Content & Align-Self

- Aligning items in a flex container

    `justify-content`: aligns items within a flex container along the main axis.

    `align-items`: aligns items within a flex container along the cross axis.

    `align-content`: control the distribution of space between the lines when there are multiple lines of flex items; multiple lines of flex items are created when flex items wrap.

    `align-self`: aligns an item inside a flex container along the cross axis; useful both for single and multiple lines of flex items.
